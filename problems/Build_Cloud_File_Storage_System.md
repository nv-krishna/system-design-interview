# Build Cloud File Storage System

## Real-life examples
- Google Drive
- Microsoft OneDrive
- Dropbox

## Requirements clarification
- **Functional requirements**
   - Upload and download: Users can upload and download files.
   - Share: Users can share their files with other users.
   - Synchronization: After updating a file on one device, it should get synchronized on all devices.
- **Non-functional requirements**
   - High availability (Users can access their files whenever and wherever they like).
   - High reliability (Any file uploaded should not be lost).
   - High consistency is desirable (It should be ok for a user doesnâ€™t see a file for a while).

## Estimation
- **Traffic estimation**
   - Our system will have huge read and write volumes.
   - Read-write ratio is expected to be nearly the same.
   - Users
      - 500 million users. (Assumed)
      - 100 million daily active users. (Assumed)
   - Files
      - Each user has 200 files. (Assumed)
      - Average file size = 100 KB (Assumed)
- **Storage estimation**
   - Total capacity needed = Number of total users x Number of files per user x Average file size = 500 million x 200 x 100 KB = 10 PB
- **Bandwidth estimation**

- **Block Server**
   - Handle upload/download file operations.
   - Update the file metadata to the metadata database after uploading files.
- **Block Storage**
   - Store chunks of files uploaded by clients.
- **Metadata Server**
   - Handle metadata-related operation.
- **Metadata Database**
   - Maintain the versioning and metadata information about files/chunks, users, devices and workspaces (sync folders).
- **Synchronization Server**
   - Get file updates from clients.
   - Sychronize file updates to clients.
   - It is designed to transmit less data between clients and the cloud storage to achieve a better response time.
- **Message Queue**
   - A communication middleware between clients and the Synchronization Server for improving efficiency and scalability.
   - Types of queues
      - Request Queues
         - Global queue and all clients will share it.
      - Response Queues
         - Each client will have its own queue for getting updates only for itself.
- **Client**
   - Components
      - Internal DB
         - Keep track of all the files, chunks, their versions, and their location in the file system.
      - Chunker
         - Split the files into smaller chunks (for uploading).
         - Reconstruct a file from its chunks (for downloading).
      - Watcher
         - Monitor the local workspace folders and notify the Indexer of any action performed by the users.
         - Listens to any changes happening on other clients that are broadcasted by the Synchronization Server.
      - Indexer
         - Process the events received from the Watcher and update the internal DB about the chunks of the modified files.
         - Notify the file changes to the Synchronization Server for broadcasting the changes to other clients.
