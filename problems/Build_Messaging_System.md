# Build Messaging System

## Real-life examples
- Facebook Chat
- Whatapp
- Slack
- Discord

## Requirements clarification
- **Functional requirements**
   - Messaging: One user can send a message to another user or a group of users.
   - Status: Shows online/offline statuses of uesrs.
   - Images and videos uploading: User can upload images and videos in addition to text messages.
   - Push notifications: Offline users can receive a push notification when there are new messages.
   - Read receipt: Senders can get a receipt when receivers read messages they sent.
- **Non-functional requirements**
   - Low latency (real-time messaging).
   - High consistency (users should be able to see the same chat history on all their devices).
   - High availability is desirable (base on CAP theorem).

## Data model definition
- **Schema**
   - Table 1: User
      - Description
         - Store user accounts

        | name | string | | The name of the conversation (like channel name in Slack). |
   - Table 4: ConversationUsers
      - Description
         - Store the relationship about which user is a part of the converation.
      - Columns
        | Column Name | Column Type | PK | Description |
        |----|----|----|----|

## High-level design
![message](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8989447/116949379-39594180-ac3f-11eb-9481-49d6d25060bb.png)

- **Chat server**
   - Orchestrate all the communications between users (The direct connection between 2 users is not reliable).
- **Message Queue**
   - Handle the communication between chat servers.
   - Each chat server will have a channel for receiving messages for that chat.
- **Object Storage**
   - Store media files.

## Detailed design
- **Users**
   - Considerations
      - Consideration 1: Users receive new messages
         - Ideas
            - It cannot be server initiated, it must be client initiated.
         - Solutions for receiving messages
            - Solution 1: HTTP polling (poor)
               - Description: Users can repeatedly ask the server if there are any new messages for them.
               - Cons: Users will send lots of unnecessary to the server.
            - Solution 2: HTTP long polling (acceptable)
               - Description
                  - A user send one request to the server.
                  - The server will hold the request, wait and response only if there is a new message for the user.
               - Cons: The server need to maintain lots of open connections.
            - Solution 3: WebSocket (good)
               - Pros
                  - Full duplex: Users and the server can send data at the same time.
                  - Connections can keep open for the duration of the session.
            - Solution 4: BOSH - Bidirectional-streams Over Synchronous HTTP

## Key points
- Use WebSocket for clients to get new messages.
