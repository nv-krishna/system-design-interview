# Build Twitter

## Requirements clarification
- **Functional requirements**
   - Post: Users can post tweets.
      - Tweets can contain photos and videos.
   - Follow: Users can follow other users.
   - Timeline: System should be able to create and display a user’s timeline consisting of top tweets from all the people the user follows.
      - User timeline: All the tweets a particular user has sent. 
      - Home timeline: A temporal merge of all the user timelines of the people are you are following. 
- **Non-functional requirements**
   - High availability.
   - Acceptable latency of generating timeline is 200ms.
   - High consistency is desirable (It should be ok for a user doesn’t see a tweet for a while).

## Estimation
- **Traffic estimation**
   - Our system will be read-heavy.
   - Users
      - 1 billion users. (Assumed)
      - 200 million daily active users. (Assumed)
      - 100 million new tweets every day. (Assumed)
      - Each user follows 200 people on average. (Assumed)
   - Number of tweets will be viewed per day
      - A user visits their timeline 2 times and visits five other people’s pages every day. (Assumed)
      - Each page has 20 tweets. (Assumed)
      - Number of tweets will be viewed per day = 200 million x ((2 + 5) x 20 tweets) = 28 billion
- **Storage estimation**
   - Types
      - Data: Yes
      - File: Yes
   - Capacity
      - Capacity for text
         - Each tweet 
            - Has 140 characters. (Assumed)
            - Need 30 bytes to store the metadata. (Assumed)
         - Each character needs 2 bytes.
         - Total size for storing new tweets per day = 100 million x (140 x 2 bytes + 30 bytes) = 30 GB
      - Capacity for photo and video
         - 20% tweets has a photo and 10% tweets has a video.
         - Photo size is 200 KB and Video size is 2 MB
         - Total size for storing new photos and videos per day = (100 million x 20% x 200 KB) + (100 million x 10% x 2MB) = 24 TB
- **Bandwidth estimation**
   - Text bandwidth = (28 billion x 280 bytes) / (24 hours x 3600 seconds) = 93 MB/s
   - Phtot bandwidth = (28 billion x 20% x 200 KB ) / (24 hours x 3600 seconds) = 13 GB/s
   - Video bandwidth = (28 billion x 10% x 30% x 2 MB ) / (24 hours x 3600 seconds) = 22 GB/s (Assume users only open to see 30% of videos in their timeline)
   - Total bandwidth = 93 MB/s + 13 GB/s + 22 GB/s = 35 GB/s

## System interface definition

## Data model definition
- **Schema**
   - Table 1: User
      - Description
         - Store user accounts.
      - Columns
        | Column Name | Column Type | PK | Description |
        |----|----|----|----|
        | UserId | int | PK | The user ID. |
        | Name | string | | The name of the user. |
        | Email | string | | The email of the user. |
        | Location | string | | The location of the user. |
        | LastLogin | datetime | | The last login time of the user. |
   - Table 2: Tweet
      - Description
         - Store the information of each tweet.
      - Columns
        | Column Name | Column Type | PK | Description |
        |----|----|----|----|
        | TweetId | int | PK | The tweet ID. |
        | UserId | int | | The user ID of the user who created the tweet. |
        | Content | string | | The text content of the tweet. |
        | Location | string | | The location of the tweet was published. |
        | CreateTime | datetime | | The time of the tweet was published. |
        | Path | string | | The URL to access the photo or video of the tweet in distributed file system. |
   - Table 3: UserFollow
      - Decription
         - Store the user following relationship.
      - Columns
        | Column Name | Column Type | PK | Description |
        |----|----|----|----|
        | FollowerUserId | int | | The follower user ID. |
        | FolloweeUserId | int | | The user ID who has been followed. |
- Data storage
   - Database
      - SQL database (We need to do join operations).
   - File storage
      - HDFS
      - Amazon S3
      - GlusterFS

## High-level design

- **Tweet Service**
   - Handle all the new tweets sent from users.
- **Fanout**
   - Take all the new tweets come in and place them into the Timeline Cache (A massive Redis cluster).
   - Query the Social Graph Service to get the user following relationship.
   - A single tweet might be written into multiple Redis instances for improving read performance.
- **Social Graph Service**
   - Hold all the following relationship information between users.
- **Timeline Cache**
   - A massive reds cluster to store all the new tweets for each active user.
- **Timeline Service**
   - Generate timeline for users.
- **Object Storage**
   - Store photos and video for tweets.

## Detailed design
- **Data sharding**
   - Options
     | Option | Description | Pros | Cons |
     |----|----|----|----|
     | By UserID | Store all the data of a user on one server. | | Load is not distributed evenly (The server holding a hot user will have a very high load comparing to the servers holding normal users). |
     | By TweetID | Store tweets based on tweet ID. | Load is distributed evenly. | Have to query all the servers for timeline generation. |
     | By Tweet creation time | Store tweets based on creation time. | Only have to query a very small set of servers for timeline generation. | Load is not distributed evenly (The server holding the latest data will have a very high load comparing to the servers holding old data). |
     | By both tweetID and tweet creation time | Store tweets based on the new tweet ID (Epoch seconds + Auto-incrementing sequence) | Reads and writes will be substantially quicker than the original tweet ID solution.<ul><li>While writing, we don't have any secondary index on tweet creation time.<li>While reading, we don’t need to filter on tweet creation time as our primary key has epoch time.</ul> | Have to query all the servers for timeline generation. |
