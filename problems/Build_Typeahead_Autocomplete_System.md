# Build Typeahead/Autocomplete System

## Requirements clarification
- **Functional requirements**
   - As the user types in their search, our system should suggest top K frequent words matching the prefix the user has typed.
- **Non-functional requirements**
   - This suggestion functionality should happen in real-time with minimal latency.

## Estimation
- **Traffic estimation**
   - Number of searches per day = 5 billion (Assumed)
   - Number of searches per second (QPS) = Number of searches per day / 24 hours / 3600 seconds = 60000 times/s
- **Storage estimation**
   - Types
      - Data: Yes
      - File: No
   - Capacity
      - Number of terms need to build an index
         - 5 billion searches per day.
         - Only 20% of these will be unique. (Assumed)
         - We only want to index the top 50% of the search terms. (Assumed)
         - Number of terms we need to build an index per day = 5 billion x 20% x 50% = 5 million
      - Size for storing the index
         - Each search has 3 words.
         - Each words has 5 characters.
         - Each character needs 2 bytes
         - Total size for storing the index per day = 5 million x 3 x 5 x 2 = 15 GB

## High-level design

- **API Servers**
   - Handle the requests from clients.
- **Trie Servers**
   - Each trie server stores a sub-trie of the whole trie.
- **Cache**
   - Cache stores top searched words.
   - API server will try to find the result from the cache first. If there is no result from the cache, it will check tries servers later.
- **Zookeeper**
   - Zookeeper will help API servers locate the proper trie server(s) for getting the results.
- **Log**
   - Log is used to store searches and track their frequencies.
- **Map-Reduce**
   - Map-Reduce will process the logging data to update the copy of the old trie to a new trie.

## Detailed design
- **Data structure**
   - Choice
      - Trie
   - General structure of Trie
      - Each node store one character.
      - Root node store an empty character.
      - The path from the root node to the leaf node can construct a word.

   - Additional features for our use case
      - Each node stores the frequency of its prefix has been searched.
      - Each node only keep top K frequent of all its children.
- **Update trie**
   - Basic idea
      - Update our trie offline after certain interval (every day or every week)
   - Normal time
      - Put new searches into a log and track their frequencies.
      - Log every search or log every 1000th search (sampling)
   - At the time to update the trie
      - Copy the old tries from servers
      - Use Map-Reduce to process the logging data to update the copy of the old tries to new tries.
      - Replace the old tries on the servers with the new tries.
