# Build Photo Sharing System

## Real-life examples
- Instagram
- Flickr
- Picasa

## Requirements clarification
- **Functional requirements**
   - Upload: Users can upload photos.
   - View: Users can view photos.
   - Search: Users can search photos.
   - Follow: Users can follow other users.
   - News feed: Users can see the top/new photos from the users they follow.
- **Non-functional requirements**
   - High availability
   - High reliability (Any photo uploaded should not be lost).
   - High consistency is desirable (It should be ok for a user doesn’t see a photo for a while).
   - Low latency is expected while viewing photos.

## Estimation
- **Traffic estimation**
   - Our system will be read-heavy.
   - Users
      - 500 million users. (Assumed)
      - 1 million daily active users. (Assumed)
   - Photos
      - 2 million new photos every day (Assumed)
      - Average photo file size = 200 KB (Assumed)
- **Storage estimation**
   - Types
      - Data: Yes
      - File: Yes
   - Capacity
      - Total capacity needed every day = Number of new photos every day x Average photo file size = 2 million x 200 KB =  400 GB
- **Bandwidth estimation**

## System interface definition

## Data model definition
- **Schema**
   - Table 1: User
      - Description
         - Store user accounts.
      - Columns
        | Column Name | Column Type | PK | Description |
        |----|----|----|----|
        | UserId | int | PK | The user ID. |
        | Name | string | | The name of the user. |
        | Email | string | | The email of the user. |
        | Location | string | | The location of the user. |
        | LastLogin | datetime | | The last login time of the user. |
   - Table 2: Photo
      - Description
         - Store the photo information.
      - Columns
        | Column Name | Column Type | PK | Description |
        |----|----|----|----|
        | PhotoId | int | PK | The photo ID. |
        | UserId | int | | The owner's user ID of the photo. |
        | Description | string | | The description of the photo. |
        | Location | string | | The location of the photo was taken. |
        | Path | string | | The URL to access the photo in distributed file system. |
   - Table 3: UserFollow
      - Decription
         - Store the user following relationship.
      - Columns
        | Column Name | Column Type | PK | Description |
        |----|----|----|----|
        | FollowerUserId | int | | The follower user ID. |
        | FolloweeUserId | int | | The user ID who has been followed. |
- Data storage
   - Database
      - SQL database (We need to do join operations).
   - File storage
      - HDFS
      - Amazon S3
      - GlusterFS

## High-level design

- **Upload Service**
   - Handle photo upload requests.
   - Create a image compression task and push it into the processing queue.
- **Processing Queue**
   - Store all the compression tasks.
   - Decouple uploading works and compression works
   - It can act as a buffer if the image compression service is unavailable or overloaded.
- **Image Compression Service**
   - Compress images from multiple quality to a single quality for storing and transferring.
- **Read Service**
   - Handle photo view and search requests.
- **Feed Generation Service**
   - Generate news feeds based on user following relationship.
- **Metadata Database**
   - Store photo, users and user following relationship information.

## Detailed design
- **Feed Generation Service**
   - Consideration 1: Generate news feed for users
      - Process
         - Get a list of people the user follows and then fetch metadata info of each user’s latest 100 photos.
         - Submit all these photos to our ranking algorithm, which will determine the top 100 photos and return them to the user.
      - Problem
         - The process of generating news feed will be slow.
      - Solution
         - Pre-generate the news feed and store it in a separate table.

## Key points
- Images need to be compressed.
- Use queue to decouple upload works with image compression works.
- Segregate uploads and reads into 2 different types of servers.
