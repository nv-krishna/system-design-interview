# Build Proximity System

## Requirements clarification
- **Functional requirements**
   - Change places: Users should be able to add/delete/update places.
   - Search places: Given their location (longitude/latitude), users should be able to find all nearby places within a given distance.
- **Non-functional requirements**
   - High availability.
   - Low latency.
   - High availability is desirable (It should be ok for a user doesnâ€™t see a place for a while).

## Estimation
- **Traffic estimation**
   - Our system will be read-heavy.

## Data model definition
- **Schema**
   - Table 1: Place
      - LocationID (8 bytes): Uniquely identifies a location.
      - Name (256 bytes)
      - Latitude (8 bytes)
      - Longitude (8 bytes)
      - Description (512 bytes)
      - Category (1 byte): E.g., coffee shop, restaurant, theater, etc.
  
## High-level design
- **Solutions**
   - SQL
      - Select * from Places where Latitude between X-D and X+D and Longitude between Y-D and Y+D
      - Not efficient
         - Need to use range to query 2 columns.
   - Grids (Static size grid)
      - Divide the whole map into smaller grids to group locations into smaller sets.
      - Select * from Places where Latitude between X-D and X+D and Longitude between Y-D and Y+D and GridID in (GridID, GridID1, GridID2, ..., GridID8)
      - It could be a problem there are a lot of places in a single grid.
   - QuadTree (Dynamic size grids)
      - Structure
         - Each node has four children.
         - If a node reaches our limit of 500 places, we will break it down to create four child nodes under it.
         - Leaf nodes represents the grids that cannot be further broken down.
         - Root node represents the whole world in one grid.
      - Traversal
         - If the current node has children, move to the child node that contains our desired location and repeat this process.
      - Find neighboring grids
         - Connect all leaf nodes with a doubly linked list.
         - Through parent nodes (each node has a pointer to access its parent).
