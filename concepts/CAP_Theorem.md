# CAP Theorem

## Concepts
- A distributed computer system can only support 2 of the 3 guarantees:
   - **Consistency**: All nodes can see the same data at the same time.
   - **Availability**: Every request receives a (non-error) response, without the guarantee that it contains the most recent write.
   - **Partition tolerance**: The system continues to work despite message loss or partial failure.

## Common Combinations
| Combination | Behaviors | Situations |
|----|----|----|
| CP | | <li>Require atomic reads and writes. |
| AP | | <li>Allow for eventual consistency <li>Need to continue working despite external errors. |
